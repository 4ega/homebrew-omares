  Enables to install nginx with the [push stream module](https://github.com/wandenberg/nginx-push-stream-module)  
  Install via ````brew install omares/omares/nginx --with-push-stream````  
  Currently the module is compiled from the development source because version 0.3.3 has issues with the push_stream_store_messages configuration.
